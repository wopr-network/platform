# Deployment Modes

Status: Canonical deployment and auth mode model  
Date: 2026-02-23

## 1. Purpose

Paperclip supports two runtime modes:

1. `local_trusted`
2. `authenticated`

`authenticated` supports two exposure policies:

1. `private`
2. `public`

This keeps one authenticated auth stack while still separating low-friction private-network defaults from internet-facing hardening requirements.

## 2. Canonical Model

| Runtime Mode | Exposure | Human auth | Primary use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local_trusted` | n/a | No login required | Single-operator local machine workflow |
| `authenticated` | `private` | Login required | Private-network access (for example Tailscale/VPN/LAN) |
| `authenticated` | `public` | Login required | Internet-facing/cloud deployment |

## 3. Security Policy

## `local_trusted`

- loopback-only host binding
- no human login flow
- optimized for fastest local startup

## `authenticated + private`

- login required
- low-friction URL handling (`auto` base URL mode)
- private-host trust policy required

## `authenticated + public`

- login required
- explicit public URL required
- stricter deployment checks and failures in doctor

## 4. Onboarding UX Contract

Default onboarding remains interactive and flagless:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai onboard
```

Server prompt behavior:

1. ask mode, default `local_trusted`
2. option copy:
- `local_trusted`: "Easiest for local setup (no login, localhost-only)"
- `authenticated`: "Login required; use for private network or public hosting"
3. if `authenticated`, ask exposure:
- `private`: "Private network access (for example Tailscale), lower setup friction"
- `public`: "Internet-facing deployment, stricter security requirements"
4. ask explicit public URL only for `authenticated + public`

`configure --section server` follows the same interactive behavior.

## 5. Doctor UX Contract

Default doctor remains flagless:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai doctor
```

Doctor reads configured mode/exposure and applies mode-aware checks. Optional override flags are secondary.

## 6. Board/User Integration Contract

Board identity must be represented by a real DB user principal for user-based features to work consistently.

Required integration points:

- real user row in `authUsers` for Board identity
- `instance_user_roles` entry for Board admin authority
- `company_memberships` integration for user-level task assignment and access

This is required because user assignment paths validate active membership for `assigneeUserId`.

## 7. Local Trusted -> Authenticated Claim Flow

When running `authenticated` mode, if the only instance admin is `local-board`, Paperclip emits a startup warning with a one-time high-entropy claim URL.

- URL format: `/board-claim/<token>?code=<code>`
- intended use: signed-in human claims board ownership
- claim action:
  - promotes current signed-in user to `instance_admin`
  - demotes `local-board` admin role
  - ensures active owner membership for the claiming user across existing companies

This prevents lockout when a user migrates from long-running local trusted usage to authenticated mode.

## 8. Current Code Reality (As Of 2026-02-23)

- runtime values are `local_trusted | authenticated`
- `authenticated` uses Better Auth sessions and bootstrap invite flow
- `local_trusted` ensures a real local Board user principal in `authUsers` with `instance_user_roles` admin access
- company creation ensures creator membership in `company_memberships` so user assignment/access flows remain consistent

## 9. Naming and Compatibility Policy

- canonical naming is `local_trusted` and `authenticated` with `private/public` exposure
- no long-term compatibility alias layer for discarded naming variants

- operator workflows: `doc/DEVELOPING.md` and `doc/CLI.md`
