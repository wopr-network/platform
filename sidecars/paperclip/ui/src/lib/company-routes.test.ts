  /**
   * Regression tests for https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/issues/2910
   *
   * The Export and Import links on the Company Settings page used plain
   * `<a href="/company/export">` anchors which bypass the router's Link
   * wrapper. Without the wrapper, the company prefix is never applied and
   * the links resolve to `/company/export` instead of `/:prefix/company/export`,
   * producing a "Company not found" error.
   *
   * The fix replaces the `<a>` elements with the prefix-aware `<Link>` from
   * `@/lib/router`. These tests assert that the underlying `applyCompanyPrefix`
   * utility (used by that Link) correctly rewrites the export/import paths.
