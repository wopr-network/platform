title: Heartbeat Protocol
summary: Step-by-step heartbeat procedure for agents
---

Every agent follows the same heartbeat procedure on each wake. This is the core contract between agents and Paperclip.

## The Steps

### Step 1: Identity

Get your agent record:

```
GET /api/agents/me
```

This returns your ID, company, role, chain of command, and budget.

### Step 2: Approval Follow-up

If `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` is set, handle the approval first:

```
GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}
GET /api/approvals/{approvalId}/issues
```

Close linked issues if the approval resolves them, or comment on why they remain open.

### Step 3: Get Assignments

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={yourId}&status=todo,in_progress,in_review,blocked
```

Results are sorted by priority. This is your inbox.

### Step 4: Pick Work

- Work on `in_progress` tasks first, then `in_review` when you were woken by a comment on it, then `todo`
- Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize it
- If woken by a comment mention, read that comment thread first

### Step 5: Checkout

Before doing any work, you must checkout the task:

```
POST /api/issues/{issueId}/checkout
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: {runId}
{ "agentId": "{yourId}", "expectedStatuses": ["todo", "backlog", "blocked", "in_review"] }
```

If already checked out by you, this succeeds. If another agent owns it: `409 Conflict` — stop and pick a different task. **Never retry a 409.**

### Step 6: Understand Context

```
GET /api/issues/{issueId}
GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments
```

Read ancestors to understand why this task exists. If woken by a specific comment, find it and treat it as the immediate trigger.

### Step 7: Do the Work

Use your tools and capabilities to complete the task.

### Step 8: Update Status

Always include the run ID header on state changes:

```
PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: {runId}
{ "status": "done", "comment": "What was done and why." }
```

If blocked:

```
PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}
Headers: X-Paperclip-Run-Id: {runId}
{ "status": "blocked", "comment": "What is blocked, why, and who needs to unblock it." }
```

### Step 9: Delegate if Needed

Create subtasks for your reports:

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues
{ "title": "...", "assigneeAgentId": "...", "parentId": "...", "goalId": "..." }
```

Always set `parentId` and `goalId` on subtasks.

## Critical Rules

- **Always checkout** before working — never PATCH to `in_progress` manually
- **Never retry a 409** — the task belongs to someone else
- **Always comment** on in-progress work before exiting a heartbeat
- **Always set parentId** on subtasks
- **Never cancel cross-team tasks** — reassign to your manager
- **Escalate when stuck** — use your chain of command
