# NemoClaw Configure Security

Presents a risk framework for every configurable security control in NemoClaw. Use when evaluating security posture, reviewing sandbox security defaults, or assessing control trade-offs.

## Context

NemoClaw ships with deny-by-default security controls across four layers: network, filesystem, process, and inference.
You can tune every control, but each change shifts the risk profile.
This page documents every configurable knob, its default, what it protects, the concrete risk of relaxing it, and a recommendation for common use cases.

For background on how the layers fit together, refer to How It Works (see the `nemoclaw-overview` skill).

<!-- TODO: uncomment after the OpenShell docs are published
:::{seealso}
OpenShell enforces the platform-level mechanisms that NemoClaw configures, including network namespace isolation, seccomp filters, SSRF protection, TLS termination, and gateway authentication.
For the full platform-level controls reference, see [OpenShell Security Best Practices](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/latest/security/best-practices.html).

## Protection Layers at a Glance

NemoClaw enforces security at four layers.
NemoClaw locks some when it creates the sandbox and requires a restart to change them.
You can hot-reload others while the sandbox runs.

The following diagram shows the default posture immediately after `nemoclaw onboard`, before you approve any endpoints or apply any presets.
