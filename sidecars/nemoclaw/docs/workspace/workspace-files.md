# Workspace Files

OpenClaw stores agent identity, behavior, and memory in a set of Markdown files inside the sandbox.
These files live at `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/` and are read by the agent at the start of every session.

## File Reference

Each file controls a distinct aspect of the agent's behavior and memory.

| File          | Purpose                                                                 | Upstream Docs                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SOUL.md`     | Core personality, tone, and behavioral rules.                           | [SOUL template](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL)         |
| `USER.md`     | Preferences, context, and facts the agent learns about you.             | [USER template](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/USER)         |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent name, creature type, emoji, and self-presentation.                | [IDENTITY template](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/IDENTITY) |
| `AGENTS.md`   | Multi-agent coordination, memory conventions, and safety guidelines.    | [AGENTS template](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/AGENTS)     |
| `MEMORY.md`   | Curated long-term memory distilled from daily notes.                    | —                                                                          |
| `memory/`     | Directory of daily note files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) for session continuity. | —                                                                          |

## Where They Live

All workspace files reside inside the sandbox filesystem:

```text
/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
├── AGENTS.md
├── IDENTITY.md
├── MEMORY.md
├── SOUL.md
├── USER.md
└── memory/
    ├── 2026-03-18.md
    └── 2026-03-19.md
```

:::{note}
The workspace directory is hidden (`.openclaw`).
The files are not at `/sandbox/SOUL.md`. Use the full path when downloading or uploading.
:::

## Persistence Behavior

Understanding when these files persist and when they are lost is critical.

| Event                     | Workspace files                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Sandbox restart           | **Preserved:** the sandbox PVC retains its data. |
| `nemoclaw <name> destroy` | **Lost:** the sandbox and its PVC are deleted.   |

:::{warning}
Always back up your workspace files before running `nemoclaw <name> destroy`.
See [Back Up and Restore](backup-restore.md) for instructions.

## Editing Workspace Files

The agent reads these files at the start of every session.
You can edit them in two ways:

1. **Let the agent do it:** Ask your agent to update its persona, memory, or user context during a session.
2. **Edit manually:** Use `openshell sandbox connect` to open a terminal inside the sandbox and edit files directly, or use `openshell sandbox upload` to push edited files from your host.
