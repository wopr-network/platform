# Use a Local Inference Server

NemoClaw can route inference to a model server running on your machine instead of a cloud API.
This page covers Ollama, compatible-endpoint paths for other servers, and two experimental options for vLLM and NVIDIA NIM.

All approaches use the same `inference.local` routing model.
The agent inside the sandbox never connects to your model server directly.
OpenShell intercepts inference traffic and forwards it to the local endpoint you configure.

## Prerequisites

- NemoClaw installed.
  Refer to the [Quickstart](../get-started/quickstart.md) if you have not installed yet.
- A local model server running, or Ollama installed. The NemoClaw onboard wizard can also start Ollama for you.

## Ollama

Ollama is the default local inference option.
The onboard wizard detects Ollama automatically when it is installed or running on the host.

If Ollama is not running, NemoClaw starts it for you.
On macOS, the wizard also offers to install Ollama through Homebrew if it is not present.

Run the onboard wizard.

```console
$ nemoclaw onboard
```

Select **Local Ollama** from the provider list.
NemoClaw lists installed models or offers starter models if none are installed.
It pulls the selected model, loads it into memory, and validates it before continuing.

### Linux with Docker

On Linux hosts that run NemoClaw with Docker, the sandbox reaches Ollama through
`http://host.openshell.internal:11434`, not the host shell's `localhost` socket.
If Ollama is already running, make sure it listens on `0.0.0.0:11434` instead of
`127.0.0.1:11434`.

```console
$ OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
```

If Ollama only binds loopback, NemoClaw can detect it on the host, but the
sandbox-side validation step fails because containers cannot reach it.

### Non-Interactive Setup

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER=ollama \
  NEMOCLAW_MODEL=qwen2.5:14b \
  nemoclaw onboard --non-interactive
```

If `NEMOCLAW_MODEL` is not set, NemoClaw selects a default model based on available memory.

| Variable            | Purpose                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER` | Set to `ollama`.                   |
| `NEMOCLAW_MODEL`    | Ollama model tag to use. Optional. |

## OpenAI-Compatible Server

This option works with any server that implements `/v1/chat/completions`, including vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, llama.cpp, LocalAI, and others.
If the server also supports `/v1/responses`, NemoClaw only favors that path when onboarding can verify tool-calling behavior that matches what OpenClaw actually sends.
Otherwise NemoClaw falls back to `/v1/chat/completions`.

Start your model server.
The examples below use vLLM, but any OpenAI-compatible server works.

```console
$ vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --port 8000
```

Run the onboard wizard.

```console
$ nemoclaw onboard
```

When the wizard asks you to choose an inference provider, select **Other OpenAI-compatible endpoint**.
Enter the base URL of your local server, for example `http://localhost:8000/v1`.

The wizard prompts for an API key.
If your server does not require authentication, enter any non-empty string (for example, `dummy`).

NemoClaw validates the endpoint by sending a test inference request before continuing.
For OpenAI-compatible endpoints, the validation prefers `/responses` only when the probe produces a compatible function or tool call.
Endpoints that return `200 OK` on `/responses` but do not format tool calls the way OpenClaw expects are configured to use `/chat/completions` instead.

### Non-Interactive Setup

Set the following environment variables for scripted or CI/CD deployments.

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER=custom \
  NEMOCLAW_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1 \
  NEMOCLAW_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=dummy \
  nemoclaw onboard --non-interactive
```

| Variable                | Purpose                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER`     | Set to `custom` for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.                                   |
| `NEMOCLAW_ENDPOINT_URL` | Base URL of the local server.                                                        |
| `NEMOCLAW_MODEL`        | Model ID as reported by the server.                                                  |
| `COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`    | API key for the endpoint. Use any non-empty value if authentication is not required. |

## Anthropic-Compatible Server

If your local server implements the Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`), choose **Other Anthropic-compatible endpoint** during onboarding instead.

```console
$ nemoclaw onboard
```

For non-interactive setup, use `NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER=anthropicCompatible` and set `COMPATIBLE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER=anthropicCompatible \
  NEMOCLAW_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  NEMOCLAW_MODEL=my-model \
  COMPATIBLE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy \
  nemoclaw onboard --non-interactive
```

## vLLM Auto-Detection (Experimental)

When vLLM is already running on `localhost:8000`, NemoClaw can detect it automatically and query the `/v1/models` endpoint to determine the loaded model.

Set the experimental flag and run onboard.

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_EXPERIMENTAL=1 nemoclaw onboard
```

Select **Local vLLM [experimental]** from the provider list.
NemoClaw detects the running model and validates the endpoint.

:::{note}
NemoClaw forces the `chat/completions` API path for vLLM.
The vLLM `/v1/responses` endpoint does not run the `--tool-call-parser`, so tool calls arrive as raw text.
:::

### Non-Interactive Setup

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_EXPERIMENTAL=1 \
  NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER=vllm \
  nemoclaw onboard --non-interactive
```

NemoClaw auto-detects the model from the running vLLM instance.
To override the model, set `NEMOCLAW_MODEL`.

## NVIDIA NIM (Experimental)

NemoClaw can pull, start, and manage a NIM container on hosts with a NIM-capable NVIDIA GPU.

Set the experimental flag and run onboard.

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_EXPERIMENTAL=1 nemoclaw onboard
```

Select **Local NVIDIA NIM [experimental]** from the provider list.
NemoClaw filters available models by GPU VRAM, pulls the NIM container image, starts it, and waits for it to become healthy before continuing.

:::{note}
NIM uses vLLM internally.
The same `chat/completions` API path restriction applies.
:::

### Non-Interactive Setup

```console
$ NEMOCLAW_EXPERIMENTAL=1 \
  NEMOCLAW_PROVIDER=nim \
  nemoclaw onboard --non-interactive
```

To select a specific model, set `NEMOCLAW_MODEL`.

## Verify the Configuration

After onboarding completes, confirm the active provider and model.

```console
$ nemoclaw <name> status
```

The output shows the provider label (for example, "Local vLLM" or "Other OpenAI-compatible endpoint") and the active model.

## Switch Models at Runtime

You can change the model without re-running onboard.
Refer to [Switch Inference Models](switch-inference-providers.md) for the full procedure.

For compatible endpoints, the command is:

```console
$ openshell inference set --provider compatible-endpoint --model <model-name>
```

If the provider itself needs to change (for example, switching from vLLM to a cloud API), rerun `nemoclaw onboard`.

## Next Steps

- [Inference Options](inference-options.md) for the full list of providers available during onboarding.
- [Switch Inference Models](switch-inference-providers.md) for runtime model switching.
- [Quickstart](../get-started/quickstart.md) for first-time installation.
