A flow is a directed graph of states, transitions, and gates that guides an AI agent through a software engineering task.

${repoSection}${yamlSection}## User Request
${userMessage}

## Instructions

1. Analyse the current YAML and understand what the user wants to change.
2. Apply the requested changes. If the YAML is empty, create a new flow from scratch.
3. Preserve any existing states, transitions, or gates that the user has NOT asked to change.
4. Use valid YAML — indentation must be consistent (2 spaces).

## Output Format

Output the updated YAML starting on the line immediately after \`UPDATED_YAML:\`. Do not wrap in markdown code fences.

UPDATED_YAML:
name: my-flow
# ... full YAML here ...

Then output a short description of what you changed, starting with \`EXPLANATION:\`:

EXPLANATION: Added a review state between coding and merging, with a gate that checks CI status.

Then output a list of specific changes (one per line), prefixed with \`+\` (added), \`~\` (modified), or \`-\` (removed), starting with \`DIFF:\`:

DIFF:
+ state: review
~ transition: coding → review (was coding → merging)
- gate: skip-review

End with the signal:

edit_complete`;
